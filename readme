This Python script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the heart.csv dataset for heart disease prediction.

Key Steps:
Data Import: Loads the dataset containing 303 patient records and 14 medical features.

Feature Descriptions: Explains column names (e.g., age, sex, chest pain type).

Target Distribution:

Uses sns.countplot to visualize the balance between patients with (46.53%) and without (53.47%) heart problems.

Confirms a roughly balanced dataset (54% healthy vs. 46% at risk).

Insights:
Helps identify patterns in heart disease risk factors.

Serves as a foundation for building predictive models (e.g., classification).

ðŸ‘‰ Run this code before model-building scripts to understand the dataset's structure and class distribution.
